    <h1>3D Cube</h1>
    <img class="center project_image" src="img/3dcube.gif" alt="gif of 3D cube">
    <div class="blog_text">
        <p>This project was made to test and apply my knowledge in linear algebra. The project was made in around 3
            days and involved many hours of testing. After learning about linear transformations, I quickly realized
            that it could be applied to recreate video
            game cameras and 3D objects. In other words, 3D graphics can be made using linear combinations with
            polyhedron vertices and origin vertices.</p>
        <p> By moving the origin vectors using trigonometric functions (since
            we want the vector to fully rotate around its plane) and applying linear combinations, we can create a 3D
            effect by calculating the location of the vertices and drawing the lines between them to fully create this
            3D cube. Depending on the operation that was desired (pitch, yaw, and roll) you would get the corresponding
            origin vectors used for the operation and use sin and cosine functions to allow for the rotation of the
            origin vertices. The project was programmed in Java due to the fast setup of a programming environment. In
            addition, it was programmed using the IntelliJ IDE.</p>

    <h1>Mario Bros 3. Recreation</h1>

    <div class="blog_text">
        <p>An incomplete recreation of Super Mario Bros 3 in Java. Feeling confident in my Java skills, this project
            became my first big and ambitious project. Although incomplete, it made me aware of multiple techniques used
            in game design. The project also allowed me to break the illusions produced by these techniques such as
            auto-scrolling. After thinking about how to move Mario around the screen, I realized that I could only make
            Mario move to either side of the screen but the level wouldn't progress. I quickly realized that 2D
            side-scrollers don't move the main character, but instead move the world around the main character and have
            the character react to the part of the world they are touching. </p>
        <p>From this project, I also learned the importance of loading assets into memory and to reuse
            assets as much as possible. At some point during development, I would read sprites from disk everytime an
            entity was brought on screen and everytime the next frame of the animation comes into play. As can be
            expected, this caused a large performance drop. At the time, I was not aware of this but then learned about
            the tool, JProfiler, which shows you where your program is spending the most time. From that program, I
            learned that it was the function reading those assets from disk. After learning that, I would revise my
            design and make it so that the assets were saved on the heap and therefore stored on RAM allowing for faster
            access of the assets and fewer calls to open the asset files.</p>
        <p>The project includes a debug mode, a level editor
            mode with a grid for easier placement of tiles and entities, functioning controls, and a functioning save
            and load system. Run time Performance increased over 500%
            during development from initial playability. The project was programmed using the IntelliJ IDE and used
            assets online to recreate sprites, animations, and SFX. Due to copyright laws, none of the assets can be
            shared. </p>

    <h1>AllShop Minecraft Plugin</h1>
    <img class="center project_image" src="img/allshop.jpg"
         alt="JPEG of a Minecraft chest next to the words 'Allshop' and subtext that says 'The everything shop plugin'">
    <div class="blog_text">
        <p>A Minecraft plugin designed for server owners to be utilized by creating an in-game market for players to
            participate that is completely customizable. The plugin was made in Java using the IntelliJ IDE, the Spigot
            API and the Vault API. The plugin allows for multiple ways to shop for items and even auction items. The
            objective of this project was to make a better shop system than what existed at the time for Minecraft
            servers. After getting frustrated at not being able to find a shopping plugin with the features I wanted and
            needing to get multiple plugins to get the desired features (creating bloat), I decided to make my own. In
            addition, this would be a chance to learn how to use external APIs and libraries. Feeling fairly skilled
            after working on the recreation of Super Mario Bros 3, I decided that I wanted to start working with
            existing programs</p>
        <p>To start off, I first needed to get the latest (of the time) version of spigot, a popular choice for
            Minecraft server binaries that allowed for more customization than the default Minecraft server
            binaries. Using the jar file, I was able to hook into and get the functions inside. From there, I proceeded
            to write the plugin but quickly realized I would need yet another API. Vault is the most common plugin that
            allows for economies within Minecraft. Deciding to use Vault, I integrated it into my plugin to allow the
            shop plugin to interact with other Vault requiring plugins. During the development, I quickly made a mess
            and had many global variables that were unsafe. I was quickly made aware of a fix for this, dependency
            injection. Dependency injection is the process of passing along needed variables to functions from a central
            function. In short, it would remove global variables.</p>
        <p>The plugin has a GUI using a chest's GUI for easy access. It had 3 different shop variations: server managed
            shops, player managed shops, and player auctions. In addition, there was the option to have secure trading
            where a party of 2 could trade items without the worry of theft. The plugin also offered physical versions
            of server controlled shops and player controlled shops in the forms of chests and a sign in front stating
            the price and the object. Customizability was a big part of the plugin and so I made these features into
            modules where you could toggle on and off these shop modes. Users also had the option to change the prefix
            of the plugin in the chat menu, and change the color of chat messages. Lastly, while testing the plugin on
            the 1.16 version of Minecraft, I discovered that the 1.14 and 1.15 versions of Minecraft were similar enough
            to 1.16 that the plugin could also be used in those versions making the plugin backwards compatible. </p>
